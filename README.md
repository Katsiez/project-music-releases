# Music Releases ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¹

##This project was created by Katarina Torninger and Amanda FlodstrÃ¶m

Week 9 project at the Technigo bootcamp was to build a music releases website using Spotify's API!

##Tech stack used:
HTML
CSS
JSX
React

## The problem

We started off by creating each component, one by one, styling and importing them until our music relases website was complete and repsonsive on all devices. If we had more time, we would have included the sidebar for which we already have styling and components for.

## View it live
